**Clean fork of the Gengo PHP lib, with just composer.json added.**

Gengo PHP Library (for the [Gengo API](http://gengo.com/api/))
======================================================================================================================================================
Translating your tools and products helps people all over the world access them; this is, of course, a somewhat tricky problem to solve.
**[Gengo](http://gengo.com/)** is a service that offers human-translation (which is often a higher quality than machine translation), and an API to
manage sending in work and watching jobs. This is a PHP interface to make using the API simpler (some would say incredibly easy).

This package contains both a client library for accessing the Gengo Translate API, as well as some example code showing how to use the library.


Installation & Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing the library is simple.

* Get the repo:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/vojtagrec/gengo-php.git
```

* Edit the `config.ini` file and set the baseurl to the environment you're sending translations to so that your API keys authenticate correctly.
